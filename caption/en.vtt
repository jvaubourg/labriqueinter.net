00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.936
(Cleaning my Internet access)
(Just by plugging a cable)

00:00:04.936 --> 00:00:07.953
Let's assume that my internet
service provider is called FABOX

00:00:07.961 --> 00:00:10.321
and that I've chosen one
of its common offers

00:00:10.336 --> 00:00:14.461
At home, all my computers
are connect via Wifi to my box.

00:00:14.461 --> 00:00:18.081
My problem is that I don't trust
my internet service provider a lot.

00:00:18.086 --> 00:00:21.401
I know for example that it is able to
watch all my online activity

00:00:21.401 --> 00:00:23.661
and that it might
sells those informations.

00:00:23.661 --> 00:00:27.903
I also know it can decide what kind
of internet service I'm allowed to use.

00:00:27.903 --> 00:00:29.610
we speak in this case of locked ports.

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:32.019
it can also choose which
website I'm able to see.

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:35.170
then we talk about
liar DNS

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.811
Finally I know it can take the initiative
to favor some destinations on the internet.

00:00:39.823 --> 00:00:42.805
For instance to make
its own services

00:00:42.805 --> 00:00:44.552
or those of its paying partners more efficient.

00:00:44.556 --> 00:00:48.608
In that case, we call that
Net Neutralitiy violations.

00:00:48.608 --> 00:00:51.976
But in the end my biggest
problem is that I'm unable

00:00:51.976 --> 00:00:55.346
to know exactly what it is
doing with my Internet access.

00:00:55.346 --> 00:00:58.565
Not only because it doesn't offer
any ethical charter about those matters

00:00:58.565 --> 00:01:01.205
but also because its
way of operating is completely opaque.

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.065
Moreover, the general Term of Use
that I've signed with it

00:01:05.065 --> 00:01:07.155
don't bind it to anything in that respect either

00:01:07.155 --> 00:01:11.003
except, possibly, to officially not
respect my privacy.

00:01:11.879 --> 00:01:14.485
The goal of this presentation
is to introduce you to

00:01:14.485 --> 00:01:17.585
a simple and effective
solution to those problems.

00:01:19.215 --> 00:01:21.913
An association which protect
a vision of the Internet

00:01:21.933 --> 00:01:23.963
and of privacy
with which I agree,

00:01:23.963 --> 00:01:25.941
gave me a little box.

00:01:25.941 --> 00:01:27.715
We will call it
"the Internet Cube"

00:01:27.715 --> 00:01:29.961
All *I* have to do to make it works

00:01:30.019 --> 00:01:32.096
is to connect it on my Internet modem

00:01:32.391 --> 00:01:35.285
From there, a new Wifi network will be available.

00:01:35.702 --> 00:01:39.228
I can connect computers from my home
to this Wifi network

00:01:39.228 --> 00:01:43.198
rather that the one of my ISP
that I was using before.

00:01:43.198 --> 00:01:46.551
By being directly connected to the Cube
my ISP cannot

00:01:46.551 --> 00:01:49.160
spy on my Internet activity anymore.

00:01:49.518 --> 00:01:51.756
In reality, he will only see encrypted traffic

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:54.353
to the sever of my association,

00:01:54.355 --> 00:01:56.381
we call this a VPN tunnel.

00:01:56.381 --> 00:01:59.643
Thus, it can't either limit or restrain

00:01:59.643 --> 00:02:01.175
my internet access.

00:02:01.175 --> 00:02:04.383
My ISP is now in realty
my association

00:02:04.388 --> 00:02:07.868
and my ISP is only one of many way I can

00:02:07.868 --> 00:02:09.446
connect to it.

00:02:09.705 --> 00:02:12.786
It is now a simple gateway to my association.

00:02:13.046 --> 00:02:14.936
The IP addresses I use on
the Internet from now

00:02:14.936 --> 00:02:16.900
are those of my association.

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.845
And for the geeks, I also now have native IPv6

00:02:19.845 --> 00:02:21.846
on all my computers at home

00:02:21.846 --> 00:02:23.645
without having anything to configure

00:02:23.883 --> 00:02:26.548
For the others, just know that
the adoption of IPv6 is primordial

00:02:26.548 --> 00:02:28.851
to keeping a sane Internet in the years to come

00:02:29.336 --> 00:02:34.251
I can now easily configure my new Wifi access,
thanks to an easy to use UI

00:02:34.251 --> 00:02:37.576
I can also freely switch from one association
to another by simply modifying

00:02:37.576 --> 00:02:41.466
the configuration of my VPN tunnel,
using the informations it will gives me.

00:02:41.466 --> 00:02:44.010
The UI are also available in French

00:02:44.753 --> 00:02:47.295
If I chose to use another ISP because I found a better offer,

00:02:47.295 --> 00:02:50.295
on a private sale website for example

00:02:50.295 --> 00:02:52.161
I just have to disconnect my Cube from the previous box

00:02:52.161 --> 00:02:55.161
and plug it into the new one.

00:02:55.161 --> 00:02:58.033
my Wifi access stay available and works immediately

00:02:58.033 --> 00:03:01.773
In the same way, without having anything to configure,
neither on my Cube

00:03:01.773 --> 00:03:04.103
nor on my computer or anywhere else

00:03:04.103 --> 00:03:07.255
if my ISP offer TV or Phone access,

00:03:07.255 --> 00:03:09.335
I can still use them

00:03:09.335 --> 00:03:11.515
and if my association has a temporary technical problem

00:03:11.515 --> 00:03:15.467
I can still connect my computer on my old Wifi network

00:03:15.467 --> 00:03:19.151
It will be a sort of downgraded Internet
access but still be available.

00:03:19.628 --> 00:03:21.671
(Self Hosting)
(in a few clicks)

00:03:21.895 --> 00:03:24.911
The Internet Cube not only
clean my Internet Access

00:03:24.911 --> 00:03:27.026
Indeed, if I make the step to protect myself

00:03:27.026 --> 00:03:30.026
against an ISP which I don't trust

00:03:30.026 --> 00:03:33.261
it doesn't make much senses to use
this new Freedom enabled Internet

00:03:33.261 --> 00:03:36.132
to give away my personal data,
to the servers of private enterprises

00:03:36.132 --> 00:03:38.122
like Google, Facebook or others...

00:03:38.122 --> 00:03:41.296
which proudly announce,
in their Terms of Use,

00:03:41.296 --> 00:03:43.086
that they will exploit my private life.

00:03:43.086 --> 00:03:45.863
the best place to store my emails
is in my own home

00:03:45.863 --> 00:03:47.553
for example in a dresser drawer

00:03:47.553 --> 00:03:49.590
rather than the computer
of someone else

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.171
that is what is commonly referred as the "cloud"

00:03:51.597 --> 00:03:53.484
the Internet Cube also allows me to

00:03:53.484 --> 00:03:55.110
easily do self-hosting

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.242
the Internet Cube, actually contains
a software

00:03:57.261 --> 00:03:59.787
called YUNOHOST which allows
people with a bit of interested

00:03:59.805 --> 00:04:02.921
in computers, but without necessarily being an expert,

00:04:02.921 --> 00:04:05.341
to easily host, in their own homes,
their own internet services

00:04:05.341 --> 00:04:08.308
available from anywhere in the world.

00:04:08.308 --> 00:04:11.308
The user interface is also available in French.

00:04:11.308 --> 00:04:14.138
Since YUNOHOST know, by default,
how to manage an email account

00:04:14.138 --> 00:04:15.428
I could, for example,
install a Webmail interface

00:04:15.428 --> 00:04:18.065
which will allow me to
easily read my emails

00:04:18.065 --> 00:04:21.535
from my browser, like with Gmail, for example.

00:04:21.535 --> 00:04:24.336
In a few clicks, I can install this service on my Cube

00:04:24.336 --> 00:04:26.967
and immediately access
it from anywhere in the world

00:04:26.971 --> 00:04:29.618
with, obviously, a secure
authentication, in that case.

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.611
There are many easy to
install services,

00:04:32.611 --> 00:04:35.195
like Jappix to chat
using instant messaging,

00:04:35.195 --> 00:04:38.103
Owncloud to share files
or even WordPress

00:04:38.103 --> 00:04:40.056
to make my own blog.

00:04:40.056 --> 00:04:43.626
By the way, the web interfaces
for the Wifi and the VPN that we just saw

00:04:43.626 --> 00:04:47.035
are simple YUNOHOST applications
that are pre-installed.

00:04:47.281 --> 00:04:49.550
Thanks to the VPN
tunnel of the Cube

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:51.430
my server is also mobile

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.783
I can plug it on any
Internet access

00:04:53.783 --> 00:04:55.693
and my services will stay available.

00:04:55.693 --> 00:04:59.569
If I change again my service provider
or if I go on holidays or if I want to cut

00:04:59.569 --> 00:05:03.481
the power in my house, for example, I only
need to unplug my Internet Cube and to

00:05:03.481 --> 00:05:07.378
plug it back anywhere else and it will work
again without the need for any reconfiguration.

00:05:07.828 --> 00:05:11.188
At the DNS level, it's the IPs of my
association that are used to

00:05:11.188 --> 00:05:14.091
contact my server
and those are fixed IPs.

00:05:15.285 --> 00:05:18.179
I can even plug my Cube
on an particularly restrained access,

00:05:18.179 --> 00:05:21.343
like a smartphone connected in 3 or 4G
for example

00:05:21.343 --> 00:05:23.903
or an especially restricted enterprise network
.

00:05:24.188 --> 00:05:26.727
For the geeks, again, wherever
I plug my Cube,

00:05:26.727 --> 00:05:29.211
my services are also
available in IPv6.

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:32.420
(Where can I find this box?)

00:05:32.633 --> 00:05:37.213
The FDN Federation is composed of associative 
ISP who respect Net Neutrality,

00:05:37.213 --> 00:05:40.528
your privacy and who provide,
increasingly, VPN services.

00:05:41.161 --> 00:05:44.846
Some of those associations offer
their own plug'n play version of the Internet Cube

00:05:44.846 --> 00:05:48.375
bundled with an optional automatic
domain name binding.

00:05:48.375 --> 00:05:51.061
and encrypted storage
for automatic backup.

00:05:51.351 --> 00:05:54.516
Since it is mandatory to
totally trust the provider

00:05:54.516 --> 00:05:56.630
you will choose for this service.

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:58.276
The associations of the Federation are

00:05:58.276 --> 00:05:59.861
spread all over France and

00:05:59.861 --> 00:06:02.265
allow you to easily
meet their members

00:06:02.265 --> 00:06:04.830
who are also generally their administrators.

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:08.343
In Belgium, the association Neutrinet,
who has also started this project

00:06:08.343 --> 00:06:10.665
will gladly welcomes you.

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:14.050
In addition, if you wish, you can use
whichever computer you want

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:17.160
and a Wifi antenna to install
YUNOHOST by yourself.

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:20.060
and the 2 applications needed for
the Wifi and the VPN

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:21.561
since everything is FreeSoftware.

00:06:21.563 --> 00:06:24.328
Then, you'll only have to choose
a VPN provider

00:06:24.328 --> 00:06:26.523
and to configure the application.

00:06:26.523 --> 00:06:29.029
The shown box cost 70€ all included

00:06:29.039 --> 00:06:32.681
and an associative VPN service
cost around 7€ per month.

00:06:33.256 --> 00:06:36.146
Combined with a classical Internet access
at 20€

00:06:36.158 --> 00:06:38.968
the result is below 30€ per month
for a movable server

00:06:38.968 --> 00:06:42.891
and a trusted associative Internet
access with TV and phone

00:06:42.891 --> 00:06:44.573
from the original Internet Service Provider.

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:47.350
(Bonus)
(More and more!)

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:51.350
As a bonus, the Internet Cube can
be modified to offer many more features

00:06:51.351 --> 00:06:53.221
as you may wish.

00:06:53.454 --> 00:06:56.094
For example, without
using the VPN application,

00:06:56.094 --> 00:06:59.348
it's also a solution to allow
everyone to easily and freely share

00:06:59.361 --> 00:07:01.726
files during a public event.

00:07:01.726 --> 00:07:05.388
We call this, as a provocative,
general label, a PirateBox

00:07:05.952 --> 00:07:09.285
Also, the Cube with the Wifi on,
only consume 2 Watts at max

00:07:09.295 --> 00:07:11.653
which is a lot less than a
commercial Box from any other ISP

00:07:11.653 --> 00:07:14.225
so it may be paired easily with a battery

00:07:14.231 --> 00:07:15.636
or a small solar panel

00:07:15.636 --> 00:07:17.943
A battery costing only 12€ allows the Internet Cube

00:07:17.943 --> 00:07:19.753
to have an autonomy of 13 hours

00:07:20.157 --> 00:07:22.795
You can also configure it to deploy
a stand alone WIFI, clean and secured,

00:07:22.805 --> 00:07:26.208
to be used in any public event.
Releasing the owner

00:07:26.211 --> 00:07:29.166
of the Internet connection
of any legal claim
