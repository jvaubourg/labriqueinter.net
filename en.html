      <h2><span>How</span> does it work?</h2>

      <p>The Internet Cube, as presented in the video above, fulfils two complementaty functions.</p>

      <p>1. It <strong>cleans your Internet access</strong>. To achieve this, it broadcast its own WiFi network. By using it, all your internet traffic goes through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network">an encrypted tunnel (VPN)</a>. This way, your Internet Service Provider (ISP) is not able to spy, filter or clamp down your internet access. In the future, the Internet Cube might integrate additional features such as automatically blocking ads and trackers, or other features to protect your privacy.</p>

      <p>2. It allows you to <strong>have your very own piece of Internet</strong>. This is what is called self-hosting : to have your own server, hosting services like a blog, a mailbox, file synchronization, contact and calendar synchronization, etc... This practice is made accessible through the <a href="https://yunohost.org">YunoHost</a> software. The Internet Cube therefore allows you to emancipate yourself from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GAFAM">the GAFAMs</a> and to take back control of your data.</p>

      <a href="#features" id="show-features-button">Detailed feature list (text)</a>
      <div id="features">
        The Internet cube has two main uses:

        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Clean your internet access:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li><span>You simply connect the Cube to your Internet Service Provider (ISP) box</span>... and that's it ;</li>
              <li><span>It will start a second wifi network</span>, which you can use to access the internet;</li>
              <li>By using this wifi rather than the one from your ISP, <span>it won't be able to spy, filter or restrict</span> your internet connection;</li>
              <li>Furthermore, <span>your computers will automatically gain native IPv6 access</span>, without the need to configure anything;</li>
              <li>If you decide to switch ISP, <span>you can just unplug and replug the Cube from one box to the other</span> and you won't need to reconfigure anything;</li>
              <li>You now have a trusted internet connection, without filtering and respectful of Net Neutrality, <span>regardless of where you connect your box</span>, it even works using 3G/4G.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Self Hosting:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>thanks to the software <a href="https://yunohost.org">YunoHost</a>, <span>the Internet Cube allows you to store your emails and other personal data at your own place</span> instead of storing them on the computer of someone else (what is commonly referred to today as <em>the cloud</em>);</li>
              <li>YunoHost allows anyone who is interested in IT, without being an expert, <span>to self-host a wide range of services</span> (emails, file sharing, blog, online calendar, etc...);</li>
              <li>thanks to the Cube, which is also an internet server, <span>you don't have to worry about the restrictions of your ISP</span>: they have disappeared;</li>
              <li><span>your server is connected to an internet access that respect Net Neutrality and which isn't censored</span>, with static IPv4 and IPv6 and there is no need to configure your ISP box;</li>
              <li>if you switch ISP, <span>you only need to unplug and replug the Internet Cube from the old box to the new one and your server will be available again</span> without the need of any configuration;</li>
              <li>if you move or switch off your electricity to go on vacation, <span>you can plug your Cube in on any internet connection</span> without having to do any configuration;</li>
              <li><span>you can even connect your portable server to an especially restricted access,</span>, like a 3/4G connection and continue to offer your services to the whole world.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Bonus:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>with a maximum consumption of only 2W with the wifi activated, the Cube can be powered <span>via a battery or a small solar Panel</span> (a 12€ battery cell can last 13h);</li>
              <li>the box is <span>open-hardware and all the software included is free software</span>;</li>
              <li>the Internet Cube can also allow you to <span>share files easily</span> during an event (this is what we call a <em>PirateBox</em>) ;</li>
              <li>you can also use it <span>to provide internet access at a public event</span>, when using someone elses connection to free it's owner from liabilities.</li>
              <li>PS: you can use the same Cube <span>to clean your internet access with its wifi hotspot and host your internet services</span>.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>

      <p>This is summarized in this sketch:</p>

      <div class="pictures schema">
        <img src="img/internetcube-schema.png" alt="Schematic" />
      </div>

      <p>Of course, since all your internet traffic will go through this tunnel, you have to trust the people managing the remote computer to which your VPN tunnel will connect. For this reason, it's better to choose an association whose members you know (e.g. an organization attached to FFDN). Some of theses associations can provide you the Cube pre-configured to connect to them.</p>

    <section id="get-an-internet-cube">
      <h2><span>How to get</span> an Internet Cube?</h2>

      <p>It is possible to either obtain an Internet Cube from local associations (about 70€ per Cube), or to assemble it yourself by purchasing the material on your side (see below).</p>

      <p>If it is possible to get an Internet Cube installed and configured ready to plug in and use, associations generally prefer to configure the Internet Cube with you to accompany you with respect to your objectives and to ensure that the Internet Cube is relevant in your case.</p>

      <p>You can contact an association <a href="https://db.ffdn.org">close to you</a>, providing VPN services and/or plug-n-play Internet Cubes (click on icons for more information):</p>

          <li>take part in the development of the Internet Cube (maintenance of the existing, backup, encryption, passage on hard disk, application to broadcast the VPN via an ethernet port, support of VPN wireguard...) or that of YunoHost</li>
          <li>enrich <a href="https://wiki.labriqueinter.net">the Internet Cube wiki</a> and <a href="https://yunohost.org/fr">the YunoHost one</a></li>
          <li>host the annual Internet Cube / YunoHost Camp</li>

<!--    <section id="replace-vpn-by-tor">
      <h2><span>Replacing the VPN</span> with Tor?</h2>

      <div class="text">
        <p>An extension to the cube is <a href="https://github.com/labriqueinternet/torclient_ynh">now available</a> (requires Wifi Hotspot) in order to offer internet access via <a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor</a>.</p>

        <p>The goal is to provide two wifi networks: one with the VPN access and another one with the Tor access (and even a third for a PirateBox). It is distributed as a simple application for YunoHost. Activating this functionality is simple as enabling it in the YunoHost web interface.</p>

        <div class="pictures">
          <a href="img/tor.png"><img src="img/tor_thumb.png" alt="Tor" /></a>
        </div>

        <p>Then, every request to the internet from the devices connected to the wifi are anonymised using the Tor network. However, to ensure real anonymity (political dissident, journalist, etc...) and prevent your browser from leaking informations about your identity, it is always recommended to directly use the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy.html">Tor Bundle</a> (only for the web and on your own computer). Furthermore, in accordance to the restrictions imposed by Tor, your internet connection is not neutral (limited to TCP and UDP for DNS requests).</p>
      </div>
    </section> -->

    <section id="anonymity-and-law">
      <h2><span>Anonymity</span> and law?</h2>

      <p>Regarding the aspect « Internet access via VPN » : the associations of the FDN Federation (FFDN) in general don't guarantee anonymity in regard to legal bodies, neither any impunity in regards of the law.</p>

      <p>The guarantee they bring at this level, is to only cooperate with the justice in the strictest framework of the law. Therefore, no data will be given away to anyone if the associated legal process is not strictly followed. We know that it's not always the case for the general public big access providers, that we can legitimately suspect them of providing information on the basis of simple phone calls from police officers or to install privileged access to their data, outside of all legal process (which are nowadays becoming <a href="https://sous-surveillance.fr">more and more optional</a>...)</p>

      <p>VPN access can only guarantee anonymity to the French or Belgian legal bodies only if the provider is located in a country that is known to not collaborate easily with France/Belgium (for example Russia, but this will imply trust in the provider and the legislation of the country).</p>

      <p>But, no matter the country, setting up the Cube with a foreign VPN provider (correctly chosen) will be especially interesting for a political dissident or a journalist who would like to protect himself against abuses from his country, to claim more freedom.</p>
